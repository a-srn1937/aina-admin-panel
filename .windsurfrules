# Aina Admin Panel Development Rules

## Project Overview
- This is the admin panel for Aina psychological testing platform
- Built with Next.js 14+ and MUI (Material-UI)
- Uses JWT authentication with phone/password login
- Supports multi-language content (variants) for tests, questions, and options

## Key Features
- User management (list users)
- Test management (CRUD operations with multi-language variants)
- Question management (with options and variants)
- Payment tracking

## Multi-Language System
- Tests, Questions, and Options have "variants" for different languages
- Each variant has: language_id, variant_type (self/other), and content fields
- variant_type: 'self' for self-assessment, 'other' for peer assessment

## API Endpoints (Backend)
- Auth: POST /auth/login (phone, password)
- Admin: GET /admin/users, /admin/tests, /admin/payments
- Tests: CRUD at /tests, variants at /tests/:id/variants
- Questions: CRUD at /questions, bulk create at /questions/bulk
- Options: CRUD at /options

## Code Quality & Architecture
- Follow clean code principles
- Use TypeScript/JavaScript with proper typing
- Implement features as reusable components
- Use React Query for data fetching

## MUI Implementation
- Use MUI components as primary UI building blocks
- DO NOT use inline CSS - use theme extensions instead
- Use the theme provider for consistent styling

## Component Development
- Keep components focused on single responsibility
- Use React Hook Form for form handling
- Implement proper loading and error states

## Project Structure
- /src/api - API hooks using React Query
- /src/sections - Page sections and views
- /src/auth - Authentication system
- /src/layouts - Layout components
- /src/components - Reusable components
